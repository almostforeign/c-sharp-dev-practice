# c-sharp-dev-practice
Preparing for junior c# dev position


# things i should know
i think the following things are the most important to learn (in no particular order)

0) c# familiarity
1) algorithms
2) data structures
3) oop concepts
4) object oriented principles (solid, dry, yagni, etc)
5) ide productivity (visual studio)
6) design patterns in .net (https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns)
7) development approach, etc.
8) uml diagrams (https://tallyfy.com/uml-diagram/)
9) agile/scrum

# detailed approaches
## c# familiarity
i should know the following things:

0) .net architecture (CLS, CTS, CLR and differences between them)
1) delegates and events
2) basic multithreading
3) collections
4) properties and indexers
5) exception handling
6) memory management (c# garbage collection)

## algorithms and data structures
i have some basic familiarity with algorithms and data structures from my class at university, but i haven't done much practice implementing or using them.

i will focus on the following algorithms and data structures:
### algorithms:
search algorithms:

0) linear search
1) binary search
2) depth-first search
3) breadth-first search

sort algorithms:

0) heap sort
1) introsort
2) insertion sort
3) bubble sort
4) quick sort
5) merge sort

### data structures:

0) trees
1) graphs
2) lists
3) stacks
4) queues
5) hashtables

## oop concepts
i should know about the following object oriented programming concepts

0) inheritance
1) containership
2) abstract classes
3) virtual functions
4) polymorphism
5) static and runtime binding
6) interfaces

## oop principles
solid:

0) single responsibility
1) open/closed
2) liskov substitution
3) interface segregation
4) dependency inversion

also:
dry -- don't repeat yourself
yagni -- you aren't gonna need it
kiss -- keep it simple stupid

## ide productivity
hancomgmd uses visual studio as its ide, so i should familiarize myself with using its debugger, refactoring tools, etc.

## design patterns in .net
i should be able to effectively implement at least some of the more frequently used and simple design patterns in c#:

0) dependency injection
1) singleton
2) generic class
3) factory method
4) strategy
5) observer
6) builder
7) adapter
8) state

## development approach, etc.
i should be familiar with the following things:

0) test-driven development
1) uml diagrams
2) agile and scrum
